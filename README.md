# odd-and-even-game.
The first vision of "the odd and even game".
The game helps people understand the difference between odd and even numbers by pressing the buttons in the Micro:Bit.
The game instruction: "After you start, you will see a random number. Press A if you think it’s odd, or B if you think’s even. Then it will indicate if you are right or wrong."
